Redo the implementation of Stroke::next() and Stroke::current().  I think I must use an iterator to find the next and current element.
The QLinkedList in qsketch.* are most probably buggy.  Fix that.
I have commented out the final else in Stroke::paint().  Must make it work. 
Try to remove warnings.
