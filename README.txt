IqHtml is a command-line tool for converting from IQNotes' XML format to an HTML file for the purpose of browsing on a desktop computer.  It was originally compiled with QT 3.1.0.

IqHtml supports text notes, sketch notes, and custom notes.  IqHtml maintains the note hierarchy and can output sketches in either JPG or PNG formats.  IqHtml also provides tabled HTML output or bulleted HTML output.  The bulleted form is useful for importing the HTML into a word processor.

Generated HTML files can be modified through a cascading style sheet called iqhtml.css that resides in the same directory as the HTML file.  An example of this file can be found with this package.

The code for interpreting sketch data in the XML was taken directly from Peter Vrabel's IQNotes code.  Many thanks for his excellent program.
